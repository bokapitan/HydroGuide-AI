# 💧 HydroGuide AI

## Project Description
HydroGuide AI is a **personalized hydration calculator** and water bottle recommendation tool designed to move users beyond the generic "eight glasses a day" rule. It calculates an individual's optimal daily water intake using a **multi-factor algorithm** based on inputs like weight, age, climate, and activity level. The product's goal is to provide accurate, science-backed hydration targets and then recommend the ideal water bottle capacity to help users effortlessly achieve those targets, optimizing their health and fitness outcomes.
